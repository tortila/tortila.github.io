Oh, hey -- I'm Oliwia and this is my blog. The idea of starting it was sparked by a one particular topic I wanted to write about. I will try to add some more posts in the near future. I have a cat.


This blog is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The theme I'm using is called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
