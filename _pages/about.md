### About me
I'm Oliwia and I currently live in Berlin. When I'm not writing new content for this blog, I'm working as a software engineer, watching movies or reading about movies. I'm probably also cuddling with my cat.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/chlebson.jpg" caption="His name is Jimmy. Not really, but that's what we tell everyone. His real name is hard to pronounce." %}{: .align-center}

My professional interests mostly include software quality, reliability and Continuous Delivery.

### About this blog
This blog started out as a space for technical content. Since I don't want to set any limits on my writing, general topics are also to be expected. For your convenience all content is not only searchable, but also assigned to various categories.

As I'm neither a professional writer/editor nor a native English speaker, please forgive me any grammatical errors and typos, and be so kind to contact me about them.

This blog is generated using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The theme I'm using is called [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).
