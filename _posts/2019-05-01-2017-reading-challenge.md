2017 is the first year when I started the Reading Challenge on Goodreads. I completed it with 24 books finished. Some of them I loved, some of them not so much, but every single one gave me something to think on.

Below is the list of the books I have read, without the chronological order.

### The stories of Ijon Tichy
- Author: Stanisław Lem
- Genre: science fiction
- Titles:
  - [The Star Diaries][tichy1]
  - [Memoirs of a Space Traveler][tichy2]
  - [The Futurological Congress][tichy3]

As a kid I've never had a hero I would idolize - I liked [Indiana Jones] and [the Warrior Princess Xena][xena] but I never really adored them. The three books featuring the adventures of [Ijon Tichy], a brave and quick-witted astronaut traveling in his spaceship across the universe, gave me the thrill of something fascinating and unknown. Not only is the character extremely likable (I'd love to have him as a friend!), his journeys are full of the most thrilling adventures and uncanny events, like getting stuck in a time loop and having to fight himself from a different time-verse. What strikes me the most, however, is that each of the stories is also a hyperbole and deals with very important philosophical topics such as: the nature of humankind and intelligence, the future of the natural environment, the Absolute (god) and the overwhelming limits of the known universe. The stories are fun to read and full of puns, but it's the moral in each of them that gives me the goosebumps.
