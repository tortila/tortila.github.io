2017 is the first year when I started the Reading Challenge on Goodreads. I completed it with 24 books finished. Some of them I loved, some of them not so much, but every single one gave me something to think on.

Below is the list of the books I have read in 2017, without the chronological order.

### The thrilling adventures of Ijon Tichy
- Author: Stanisław Lem
- Genre: science fiction
- Titles:
  - [The Star Diaries][tichy1]
  - [Memoirs of a Space Traveler][tichy2]
  - [The Futurological Congress][tichy3]
[tichy1]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/889418.The_Star_Diaries
[tichy2]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88321.Memoirs_of_a_Space_Traveler
[tichy3]: https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/733473.The_Futurological_Congress

If I read these books as a kid, the main character, [Ijon Tichy], would definitely become my idol. Countless stories across three books featuring the adventures of a brave and quick-witted astronaut traveling in his spaceship across the universe, gave me the thrill of something fascinating and unknown. Not only is the character extremely likable, his journeys are full of the most thrilling adventures and uncanny events, like getting stuck in a time loop and having to fight himself from a different time-verse. What strikes me the most, however, is that each of the stories is also a hyperbole and deals with very important philosophical topics such as: the nature of humankind and intelligence, the future of the natural environment and the overwhelming limits of the known universe. The stories are fun to read and full of puns, but it's the moral in each of them that gives me the goosebumps.
